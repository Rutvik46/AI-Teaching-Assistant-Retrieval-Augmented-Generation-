Project Title: AI Teaching Assistant

Getting started:

- There are total two Jupiter notebook files in the submitted repository. 

1. SEP_775_AI_TA_Core_Implementation.ipynb file contains the main code of implementation of AI TA (RAG). 
   This file contains code to download LlaMa-2 7b model, course files as well as other implementation.  

2. SEP_775_AI_TA_Evaluation_Code.ipynb file shows the evaluation of our AI TA and other experiments done 
   with certain hyperparameters to tune them as mentioned into the final report.


Necessary Libraries and Dependencies to Install:

1. Name: langchain             Version: 0.1.14
2. Name: sentence-transformers Version: 2.6.1
3. Name: faiss-cpu             Version: 1.8.0
4. Name: pdfminer.six          Version: 20231228
5. Name: llama_cpp_python      Version: 0.2.58
6. Name: tiktoken              Version: 0.6.0
7. Name: gdown                 Version: 5.1.0

(Note: If you get an error related to building wheel for llama-cpp-python package. 
You will need to install C++ compiler because of the dependency of llama-cpp-python library.
please follow the instruction mentioned into these resources.

2. https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/

Tool to install:
1.Desktop development with C++
2.Windows 10 SDK.) 

Code Description:

- First of all, run SEP_775_AI_TA_Core_Implementation.ipynb file in order to install all the libraries, 
  download necessaries model files, extract text to create a vector database, set up model and 
  prompt template as well as question answering chain to interact with AI TA. 
  If in the response of the models, it provides internal logs such as time taken by generating each token, 
  set up verbose= False to stop this streamimg when it calls LlamaCPP Class, 

- This file load LLM model from the working repository where it was downloaded.
  So, do not move model any where or adjust the path in code accordingly  

- Run the file SEP_775_AI_TA_Evaluation_Code.ipynb in order to test evaluation parameters. 
  This file load an CSV file where we have saved questions and answers pairs to measure BLUE score as well as response time.     


Streamlit App:

- There is one more file streamlit_App.py inside the submitted repository. 
- There are two other repositories named user_files and vectorstore generated by this App. user_file containes the files submitted by the user using this app. 
  and vectorstore contains the vector database index.
- This python file is a nice streamlit user interface app. so that students can interact with AI TA using this interface.
- I recommend to create a virtual environment of python and install all packages mentioned in requirement.txt file to run this app.
- Make sure that you first go to repository using CMD where app file and llama model (downloaded using implementation code file) are located because 
  it loads model from the working repository. 
- Command to run this app - 1. cd <file_repository_path>				
			  - 2. streamlit run "<streamlit_App.py file path>" [ARGUMENTS]
- This app will be deployed locally to interact with LLAMa-2 7b based AI Teaching Assistant.
